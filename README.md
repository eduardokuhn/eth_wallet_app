# Description
This app is not for production use and was strictly developed as a prototype for the purpose of testing crypto API and jetpack compose, which I used for the first time. I'm sorry if there are any bugs or if the app is not responsive to your display layout. As I said, this app is a prototype developed to test the technology and was not intended for use in production. 
I may have ended up implementing some patterns wrong, so don't be 100% oriented in the development method applied in this project, as this is the first app I developed with jetpack compose.
